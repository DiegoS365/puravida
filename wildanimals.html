<p>north america-he American bison was named the national mammal of the United States on May 9, 2016. 
This majestic animal joins the ranks of the Bald Eagle as the official symbol of our country

<p>A wild animal is an animal that is, well, wild. This means that it isn't tame and it lives on
 its own without any help from people. A wild animal finds its own food, shelter,
 water and all its other needs in a specific natural habitat.
